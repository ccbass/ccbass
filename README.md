## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Colin, a full-stack software engineer.
_By nature, I am a builder.  My background is diverse from construction, logistics, volunteer management, and sewing._

<br>
I checked out a hack-a-thon last year and fell in love with building in the digital space. <br>
When I'm away from my desk, you can find me mountain biking, backpacking, sewing, or baking sourdough.  <br>
